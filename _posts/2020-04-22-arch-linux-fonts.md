title: 'Arch Linux: fonts'

I was seeing a lot of &#9647;&#9647;&#9647;&#9647; when trying to track a package shipped from China and decided to find a reasonable collection of fonts. The [Google Noto font sets](https://www.google.com/get/noto/) seem like the best free collection.

$ sudo pacman -Syu noto-fonts noto-fonts-cjk noto-fonts-emoji noto-fonts-extra
```
