title: 'Moved to GitHub Pages / Jykell'
---

I have moved my website to `Github Pages`.  It uses `Jykell` to generate a static site.  Find out more at [pages.github.com](https://pages.github.com/).

I am using theme [jekyll/minima][jekyll-minima].  I have integrated `master` into my website repository because the current released version, `2.5.1`,  doesn't have skins; 3.x will have skins.  The site would be very white without this skin.

To add a new post I just add a new markdown or html file to the `_post` directory with a little header.  I can even do this from the GitHub web interface.  The repository can also be cloned and served with `jekyll` to view locally as you work on it.

## TODO
define language for syntax highlighting on old posts
